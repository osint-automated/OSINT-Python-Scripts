import requests
"""
Checks the status of each URL in the 'links' list using HTTP GET requests.
If a URL returns a status code of 200 (OK), it is added to 'new_link_list'.
Any exceptions during the request are caught and printed with the corresponding URL.
Finally, prints the list of URLs that are up (status code 200).
