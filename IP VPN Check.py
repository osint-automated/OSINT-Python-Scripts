import requests
"""
This script reads a list of IP addresses from a user-specified CSV file, checks each IP for VPN or proxy usage using the ip-api.com service, 
and writes the results to a new CSV file named 'results.csv'.
Features:
- Prompts the user for the input CSV filename.
- For each IP address, queries the ip-api.com API to determine if it is associated with a VPN, proxy, or hosting provider.
- Handles API errors and invalid IPs gracefully.
- Outputs results in a CSV file with columns: 'IP', 'VPN/Proxy'.
- Includes basic error handling for file operations and network requests.
Usage:
Run the script and enter the name of the CSV file containing IP addresses when prompted.
